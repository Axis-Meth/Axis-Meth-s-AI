UPDATE INFO 3: Hi. It's been some time since last update and I've got some good news for you all. I am back to GitHub and Axis Meth's AI ver 0.3 will get released sometime in Febrary. Untill then, we will role 3 bugfixes updates with new prompts and quality of life fixes.

Axis Meth is creating a powerful AI Tool that can answer to your questions in a few seconds. 

How to use: In order for this AI to work, everytime you ask a new question, you have to start with a capitalized letter, otherwise it won't work. Capitalized letters do matter if you ask questions about countries, cities, names or other stuff that require a capitalized letter at first.

Important note! This tool is currently in an unstable version, which means the code might break from time to time. Another thing is that there are only a few questions that are really basic. This is just a test to see how well the code does. If you have any issues with the code, please write in the Issues Tab. If you have any ideas, write a comment. Thank you.
